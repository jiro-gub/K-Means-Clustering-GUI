## Project Title
K-means Clustering Analysis Tool for Educational Data

## Project Description
This interactive web application implements K-means clustering analysis using Streamlit and scikit-learn. The tool allows users to upload educational data and perform cluster analysis with real-time visualization and quality metrics. It features:

- Interactive data preprocessing and feature selection
- Dynamic cluster visualization with centroids
- Automatic elbow point detection for optimal cluster selection
- Multiple clustering quality metrics
- Correlation analysis between features
- Cluster distribution analysis



## Output & Visualization

### 1. Clustered Data View
The application displays the processed data with cluster assignments, showing standardized values for each feature and the assigned cluster labels.

### 2. Cluster Visualization
![Cluster Visualization]
The scatter plot shows:
- Data points colored by cluster assignment
- Cluster centroids marked with red X's
- Clear separation between some clusters
- Overlapping regions indicating potential cluster boundaries

### 3. Cluster Distribution
The bar chart shows the distribution of samples across clusters:
- Cluster 0: ~32 samples
- Cluster 1: ~17 samples
- Cluster 2: ~30 samples
- Cluster 3: ~24 samples
- Cluster 4: ~12 samples

### 4. Quality Metrics
- Silhouette Score: 0.061
- Calinski-Harabasz Score: 7.0

### 5. Elbow Method Analysis
The elbow curve shows the relationship between number of clusters and inertia, with an elbow point at k=3.

## Insights from Analysis

1. **Cluster Quality**
   - The low Silhouette score (0.061) indicates that clusters are not well-separated
   - The moderate Calinski-Harabasz score (7.0) suggests some structure in the data, but with significant overlap

2. **Cluster Distribution**
   - Uneven cluster sizes indicate natural groupings in the data
   - Largest cluster (Cluster 0) contains approximately 32 samples
   - Smallest cluster (Cluster 4) contains about 12 samples

3. **Feature Relationships**
   - AGE and SEX show discrete groupings in the scatter plot
   - Clear pattern of clustering around specific values
   - Some outliers visible in the scatter plot

4. **Optimal Clustering**
   - Elbow method suggests k=3 as optimal number of clusters
   - Current visualization uses k=5, showing more granular groupings
   - Trade-off between cluster granularity and separation quality

5. **Educational Implications**
   - Distinct student groups identified based on age and sex
   - Potential for targeted educational interventions based on cluster characteristics
   - Some overlap between groups suggests shared characteristics across clusters

6. **Data Structure**
   - Discrete nature of data points suggests categorical or ordinal variables
   - Clear horizontal and vertical alignments indicate standardized or normalized values
   - Multiple features contribute to the final clustering solution

These insights can be valuable for:
- Understanding student groupings
- Developing targeted educational strategies
- Identifying patterns in student characteristics
- Making data-driven decisions in educational planning
